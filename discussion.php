    <h5 class="card-title"><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b></h5>
    <p class="card-text">There are many benefits to having online discussions even in a face-to-face (f2f) course. 
    <br> From fully f2f to blended to fully online, the students can expand their learning outside the classroom through interactive dialogue with their peers and the instructor. 
     <br>An online discussion is very similar to a f2f talk in that they require moderation and active management by the instructor, preparation time, and summarization of the concepts covered.
      <br>In this learning guide an online discussion is defined as communication between instructors and students using interactive communication tools. These tools can take many forms, from chat sessions, to discussion forums, to video chat. 
    <br>The value of the online discussion is that even those students who are shy and timid can find the time to express their views, and more in-depth dialogue between students-students can occur.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title"><b><u>PURPOSE</b></u></h5>
    <p class="card-text">The main objective of Learning Management Systems is to enhance the learning process.
     <br>A Learning Management System not only delivers content, but also handles registering courses, course administration, skill gap analysis, tracking, and reporting. 
     <br>Most LMSs are web based and are used in various educational institutes and companies to improve classroom teaching, learning methodology, and company records. They are used in various industries and scenarios like in financial services, compliance training, computer based training, online assessment, collaborative learning, application sharing, and so on. Some LMSs also include a performance management system which encompasses employee appraisal, competency management, and skill gap analysis.</p>

    <p class="card-text">Using a learning management system can provide many benefits for your organization. 
    <br>The ultimate goal is ensuring that all learners are treated to an experience that honors their learning style. However, at the same time, companies must justify the costs and time invested in this effort.</p>
